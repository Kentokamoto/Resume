### App Launch Inference <span style="float: right"> (August 2016 - August 2017) </span>
#### Tech Stack: Python, Wireshark
* Research security vulnerabilities by eavesdropping on app launch instances on Android devices
* Utilized scikit-learn to train and infer app network packets on each device
* Successfully inferred app launches with 90\% or higher accuracy using Random Forest and SVM classifiers

### Pool Table Recognition <span style="float: right"> (April 2016 - December 2016) </span>
* Built C++ program to detect pool tables from a smartphone image using OpenCV
* Final image displayed a top-down perspective of the table
